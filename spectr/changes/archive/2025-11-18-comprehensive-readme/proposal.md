# Change: Comprehensive README Documentation

## Why
The current README is minimal (8 lines) and provides insufficient information for both users and developers. It lacks installation instructions, usage examples, command reference, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines. A comprehensive README is critical for project discoverability, onboarding, and community contribution.

## What Changes
- Replace minimal 8-line README with comprehensive 400+ line documentation
- Add installation instructions (direct binary, Nix, building from source)
- Add quick-start guide with workflow examples
- Add command reference for all CLI commands (init, list, validate, archive, view)
- Add architecture overview for developers
- Add contributing guide with testing and development setup
- Add troubleshooting section
- Add links to relevant specification documents
- Maintain visual branding with logo and description

## Impact
- Affected specs: documentation (new capability)
- Affected code: README.md only (no code changes)
- Breaking changes: None
- User-facing: Yes (primary artifact)
- Developer-facing: Yes (development guide and architecture)
