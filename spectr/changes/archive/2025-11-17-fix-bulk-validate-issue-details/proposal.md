# Change: Fix Bulk Validation to Show Issue Details

## Why

When users run `spectr validate --all --strict`, they see that items failed validation and the count of issues (e.g., "4 issue(s)"), but the actual issue details are not displayed. This forces users to run individual validation commands for each failed item to see what's wrong, which is inefficient and frustrating.

The issue exists because `printBulkHumanResults()` in `cmd/validate_print.go:63-98` only prints the issue count but doesn't iterate through and display the actual issues like `printHumanReport()` does.

## What Changes

- Modify the bulk validation human-readable output to display full issue details (level, path, message) for each failed item
- Ensure the output format is consistent with single-item validation output
- Maintain the summary line showing pass/fail counts

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: cli-framework (Validate Command Structure requirement), cli-interface (validate command output format)
- **Affected code**: `cmd/validate_print.go` (printBulkHumanResults function)
- **User experience**: Users will see full validation details immediately instead of needing to re-run validation per item
