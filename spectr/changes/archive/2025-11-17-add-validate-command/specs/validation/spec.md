# Validation Capability Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Spec File Validation
The validation system SHALL validate spec files for structural correctness and adherence to Spectr conventions.

#### Scenario: Valid spec with all required sections
- **WHEN** a spec file contains Purpose and Requirements sections with properly formatted requirements and scenarios
- **THEN** validation SHALL pass with no errors

#### Scenario: Requirement missing SHALL or MUST
- **WHEN** a requirement text does not contain "SHALL" or "MUST" keywords
- **THEN** validation SHALL report a WARNING level issue
- **AND** the message SHALL suggest using normative language

#### Scenario: Incorrect scenario format
- **WHEN** scenarios use formats other than "#### Scenario:" (e.g., bullets or bold text)
- **THEN** validation SHALL report an ERROR
- **AND** the message SHALL show the correct "#### Scenario:" header format

### Requirement: Change Delta Validation
The validation system SHALL validate change delta specs for structural correctness and delta operation validity.

#### Scenario: Valid change with deltas
- **WHEN** a change directory contains specs with proper ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED sections
- **THEN** validation SHALL pass with no errors
- **AND** each delta requirement SHALL be counted toward the total

#### Scenario: Change with no deltas
- **WHEN** a change directory has no specs/ subdirectory or no delta sections
- **THEN** validation SHALL fail with an ERROR
- **AND** the message SHALL explain that at least one delta is required
- **AND** remediation guidance SHALL explain the delta header format

#### Scenario: Delta sections present but empty
- **WHEN** delta sections exist (## ADDED Requirements) but contain no requirement entries
- **THEN** validation SHALL fail with an ERROR
- **AND** the message SHALL indicate which sections are empty
- **AND** guidance SHALL explain requirement block format

#### Scenario: ADDED requirement without scenario
- **WHEN** an ADDED requirement lacks a "#### Scenario:" block
- **THEN** validation SHALL fail with an ERROR
- **AND** the message SHALL indicate which requirement is missing scenarios

#### Scenario: MODIFIED requirement without scenario
- **WHEN** a MODIFIED requirement lacks a "#### Scenario:" block
- **THEN** validation SHALL fail with an ERROR
- **AND** the message SHALL require at least one scenario for MODIFIED requirements

#### Scenario: Duplicate requirement in same section
- **WHEN** two requirements with the same normalized name appear in the same delta section
- **THEN** validation SHALL fail with an ERROR
- **AND** the message SHALL identify the duplicate requirement name

#### Scenario: Cross-section conflicts
- **WHEN** a requirement appears in both ADDED and MODIFIED sections
- **THEN** validation SHALL fail with an ERROR
- **AND** the message SHALL indicate the conflicting requirement and sections

#### Scenario: RENAMED requirement validation
- **WHEN** a RENAMED section contains well-formed "FROM: X TO: Y" pairs
- **THEN** validation SHALL accept the renames
- **AND** SHALL check for duplicate FROM or TO entries
- **AND** SHALL error if MODIFIED references the old name instead of new name

### Requirement: Validation Report Structure
The validation system SHALL produce structured validation reports containing issue details and summary statistics.

#### Scenario: Report with errors and warnings
- **WHEN** validation encounters both ERROR and WARNING level issues
- **THEN** the report SHALL list all issues with level, path, and message
- **AND** the summary SHALL count errors, warnings, and info separately
- **AND** valid SHALL be false if any errors exist

#### Scenario: Report in strict mode
- **WHEN** validation runs in strict mode
- **THEN** the report SHALL treat warnings as failures
- **AND** valid SHALL be false if errors OR warnings exist
- **AND** exit code SHALL be non-zero for warnings in strict mode

#### Scenario: JSON output format
- **WHEN** validation is invoked with --json flag
- **THEN** the output SHALL be valid JSON
- **AND** SHALL include items array with per-item results
- **AND** SHALL include summary with totals and byType breakdowns
- **AND** SHALL include version field for format compatibility

### Requirement: Bulk Validation with Concurrency
The validation system SHALL support validating multiple items in parallel for performance.

#### Scenario: Parallel validation of multiple items
- **WHEN** bulk validation is invoked with multiple specs and changes
- **THEN** validation SHALL process items concurrently using a worker pool
- **AND** concurrency SHALL be configurable via flag or environment variable
- **AND** default concurrency SHALL be 6 workers

#### Scenario: Validation queue management
- **WHEN** the number of items exceeds worker pool size
- **THEN** items SHALL be queued and processed as workers become available
- **AND** progress indicators SHALL update as items complete (if not JSON mode)
- **AND** results SHALL be collected and sorted by item ID

#### Scenario: Error handling in parallel validation
- **WHEN** validation of one item fails with an error (not validation issue, but runtime error)
- **THEN** the error SHALL be captured in the results for that item
- **AND** validation of other items SHALL continue
- **AND** the final exit code SHALL indicate failure

### Requirement: Item Discovery
The validation system SHALL discover specs and changes within the project directory structure.

#### Scenario: Discover active changes
- **WHEN** the system scans the spectr/changes/ directory
- **THEN** it SHALL return all subdirectories except "archive"
- **AND** each subdirectory name SHALL be a change ID

#### Scenario: Discover specs
- **WHEN** the system scans the spectr/specs/ directory
- **THEN** it SHALL return all subdirectories containing a spec.md file
- **AND** each subdirectory name SHALL be a spec ID

#### Scenario: Handle missing directories
- **WHEN** spectr/changes/ or spectr/specs/ does not exist
- **THEN** discovery SHALL return empty list for that category
- **AND** SHALL NOT error on missing directories

### Requirement: Interactive Validation Mode
The validation system SHALL support interactive selection when invoked without arguments in a TTY.

#### Scenario: Interactive mode prompt
- **WHEN** validate command is invoked without arguments in an interactive terminal
- **THEN** it SHALL prompt user with options: All, All changes, All specs, Pick specific item
- **AND** user SHALL be able to select option using arrow keys
- **AND** selected option SHALL be executed

#### Scenario: Non-interactive environment detection
- **WHEN** validate command is invoked without arguments in non-interactive environment (CI/CD)
- **THEN** it SHALL print usage hints for non-interactive invocation
- **AND** SHALL exit with code 1
- **AND** SHALL NOT hang waiting for input

### Requirement: Helpful Error Messages
The validation system SHALL provide actionable error messages with remediation guidance.

#### Scenario: Error with remediation steps
- **WHEN** validation fails due to missing required content
- **THEN** the error message SHALL explain what is wrong
- **AND** SHALL provide "Next steps" section with concrete actions
- **AND** SHALL include format examples when applicable

#### Scenario: Ambiguous item name
- **WHEN** user provides an item name that matches both a change and a spec
- **THEN** validation SHALL report the ambiguity
- **AND** SHALL suggest using --type flag to disambiguate
- **AND** SHALL show available type options (change, spec)

#### Scenario: Item not found with suggestions
- **WHEN** user provides an item name that does not exist
- **THEN** validation SHALL report item not found
- **AND** SHALL provide nearest match suggestions based on string similarity
- **AND** SHALL limit suggestions to 5 most similar items

### Requirement: Exit Code Conventions
The validation system SHALL use exit codes to indicate success or failure for scripting and CI/CD.

#### Scenario: Successful validation
- **WHEN** all validated items pass without errors (or warnings in strict mode)
- **THEN** the command SHALL exit with code 0

#### Scenario: Validation failures
- **WHEN** any validated item has errors (or warnings in strict mode)
- **THEN** the command SHALL exit with code 1

#### Scenario: Runtime errors
- **WHEN** the command encounters runtime errors (file not found, parse errors)
- **THEN** the command SHALL exit with code 1
