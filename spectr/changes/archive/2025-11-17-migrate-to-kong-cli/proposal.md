# Change: Migrate to Kong CLI Library Instead of Cobra

## Why
The current CLI implementation uses Cobra, which requires extensive boilerplate code with builder patterns and manual command registration. Kong offers a more maintainable, type-safe approach using struct tags and Go's type system, reducing code complexity and improving developer experience.

## What Changes
- Replace `github.com/spf13/cobra` dependency with `github.com/alecthomas/kong`
- Refactor CLI command structure from Cobra's imperative builder pattern to Kong's declarative struct-based approach
- Convert root command and init command to Kong struct definitions
- Replace manual flag registration with Kong struct tags
- Update command execution flow to use Kong's built-in parsing and method dispatch
- Remove unnecessary boilerplate code for command registration and flag handling

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: `cli-framework` (new capability specification)
- **Affected code**:
  - `main.go` - Update to use Kong parser instead of Cobra Execute
  - `cmd/root.go` - Convert to Kong CLI struct definition
  - `cmd/init.go` - Convert to Kong command struct with tags
  - `go.mod` - Replace cobra dependency with kong
  - All future command additions will use Kong patterns

## Benefits
- **Less boilerplate**: Struct tags replace verbose builder method chains
- **Type-safe**: Direct use of Go's type system for command structure
- **Better maintainability**: Declarative approach is easier to understand and modify
- **Automatic help generation**: Help text derived from struct tags
- **Cleaner validation**: Lifecycle hooks enable better input validation
