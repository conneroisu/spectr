- **WHEN** a delta spec has no ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED sections
- **THEN** the system returns an error indicating no delta operations were found

### Requirement: Delta Operation Application Order
The system SHALL apply delta operations in the order: RENAMED → REMOVED → MODIFIED → ADDED to ensure correct merging.

#### Scenario: Apply RENAMED first
- **WHEN** applying delta operations
- **THEN** RENAMED operations are applied first to update requirement names before other operations

#### Scenario: Apply REMOVED second
- **WHEN** applying delta operations
- **THEN** REMOVED operations are applied after RENAMED to delete requirements

#### Scenario: Apply MODIFIED third
- **WHEN** applying delta operations
- **THEN** MODIFIED operations are applied after REMOVED to update existing requirements

#### Scenario: Apply ADDED last
- **WHEN** applying delta operations
- **THEN** ADDED operations are applied last to insert new requirements

### Requirement: Requirement Name Normalization
The system SHALL normalize requirement names by trimming whitespace and using case-insensitive matching to prevent duplicates.

#### Scenario: Normalize whitespace
- **WHEN** comparing requirement names
- **THEN** the system trims leading and trailing whitespace

#### Scenario: Case-insensitive matching
- **WHEN** comparing requirement names
- **THEN** the system uses lowercase comparison to match requirements

#### Scenario: Prevent duplicates due to formatting
- **WHEN** requirements differ only in whitespace or case
- **THEN** the system treats them as the same requirement

### Requirement: Spec Merging Algorithm
The system SHALL merge delta operations into base specs while preserving requirement ordering.

#### Scenario: Preserve original requirement order
- **WHEN** merging modified or renamed requirements
- **THEN** the system maintains their original position in the requirements list

#### Scenario: Append new requirements at end
- **WHEN** adding new requirements
- **THEN** the system appends them after all existing requirements

#### Scenario: Rebuild requirements section
- **WHEN** merging is complete
- **THEN** the system reconstructs the spec with proper markdown structure and spacing

### Requirement: New Spec Creation
The system SHALL create new spec files when a delta spec has no corresponding main spec.

#### Scenario: Generate spec skeleton for new specs
- **WHEN** creating a new spec file
- **THEN** the system generates a skeleton with title, purpose placeholder, and requirements section

#### Scenario: Restrict operations for new specs
- **WHEN** creating a new spec
- **THEN** only ADDED operations are allowed (MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED return an error)

#### Scenario: Error on invalid operations for new specs
- **WHEN** a delta spec for a new capability contains MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED operations
- **THEN** the system returns an error indicating only ADDED is allowed for new specs

### Requirement: Post-Merge Validation
The system SHALL validate rebuilt specs before writing them to ensure correctness.

#### Scenario: Validate rebuilt spec structure
- **WHEN** a spec has been rebuilt from delta operations
- **THEN** the system validates the spec structure before writing

#### Scenario: Prevent writing invalid specs
- **WHEN** post-merge validation fails
- **THEN** the system aborts the archive operation without writing any specs

#### Scenario: Display validation errors
- **WHEN** post-merge validation fails
- **THEN** the system displays detailed validation errors with file paths and issue descriptions

### Requirement: Atomic Spec Updates
The system SHALL prepare all spec updates before writing to ensure all-or-nothing consistency.

#### Scenario: Prepare all updates first
- **WHEN** processing multiple delta specs
- **THEN** the system builds and validates all updated specs before writing any files

#### Scenario: Abort on first validation error
- **WHEN** any spec fails validation during preparation
- **THEN** the system aborts without writing any spec files

#### Scenario: Write all specs after validation
- **WHEN** all specs pass validation
- **THEN** the system writes all updated specs to their main spec locations

### Requirement: Spec Update Display
The system SHALL display spec update operations with clear formatting and counts.

#### Scenario: Display specs to be updated
- **WHEN** spec updates are prepared
- **THEN** the system lists each spec with "create" or "update" status

#### Scenario: Display operation counts per spec
- **WHEN** applying spec updates
- **THEN** the system displays counts: "+ N added, ~ N modified, - N removed, → N renamed" per spec

#### Scenario: Display total operation counts

- **THEN** the system displays totals across all specs

### Requirement: Spec Update Confirmation
The system SHALL prompt for confirmation before applying spec updates unless --yes flag is provided.

#### Scenario: Prompt for spec update confirmation
- **WHEN** spec updates are ready to apply
- **THEN** the system prompts "Proceed with spec updates?" and waits for user response

#### Scenario: Skip prompt with yes flag
- **WHEN** --yes flag is provided
- **THEN** the system proceeds with spec updates without prompting

#### Scenario: Skip updates when user declines
- **WHEN** user declines spec update prompt
- **THEN** the system skips spec updates but continues with archive operation

### Requirement: Archive Success Reporting
The system SHALL display clear success messages after archiving.

#### Scenario: Display archive success
- **WHEN** archive operation completes successfully
- **THEN** the system displays "Change '<change-id>' archived as '<archive-name>'"
