# Change: Add Naming Philosophy Note to README

## Why

Users and contributors may wonder whether the choice to name the specs directory "spectr" and the CLI tool "spectr" is arbitrary or deliberate. By documenting the reasoning behind this naming decision and sharing the results of our testing across AI models, we establish clarity on design intentions and provide transparency to the community about how we approach naming conventions in this project.

## What Changes

- Add a new "Why 'spectr'?" section to README.md immediately after the Overview section
- Document the naming journey: alternatives tested, criteria evaluated, and findings from AI model compatibility testing
- Explain how the name "spectr" was chosen through systematic evaluation across multiple AI models (Claude, GPT, etc.)

## Impact

- **Affected sections**: README.md (documentation only)
- **Affected code**: None
- **Breaking changes**: None
- **Capability changes**: None (pure documentation)
- **User impact**: Improved transparency about design decisions; aids new contributors in understanding project values
