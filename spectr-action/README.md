# spectr-action

> GitHub Action for validating spec-driven development projects using Spectr

This action automatically validates your specification-driven codebase by running `spectr validate --all --strict --json` and reporting issues as GitHub annotations.

## Purpose

### What is Spectr?

[Spectr](https://github.com/conneroisu/spectr) is a spec-driven development tool that helps teams maintain consistency between specifications and implementations. It enforces that all changes are properly documented through proposals, specifications, and structured deltas.

### What does this action do?

This action:
- Installs the specified version of Spectr (or latest)
- Runs comprehensive validation on your `spectr/` directory
- Creates GitHub annotations for any errors, warnings, or info messages
- Fails the workflow if validation errors are found (or warnings, if strict mode is enabled)
- Provides detailed file locations and line numbers for issues

### When to use this action

Use this action as part of your CI/CD pipeline for projects that follow spec-driven development:
- On every pull request to validate proposed changes
- On push to main/master to ensure spec integrity
- As a required status check before merging
- In combination with other validation steps

## Quick Start

Add this to your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/spectr.yml`):

```yaml
name: Spectr Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1
```

That's it! The action will use the latest version of Spectr and run in strict mode by default.

## Inputs

### `version`
**Description:** The version of Spectr to use (e.g., `0.1.0`).
**Required:** No
**Default:** `latest`

### `checksum`
**Description:** Optional checksum for verifying the downloaded Spectr binary.
**Required:** No
**Default:** None

### `github-token`
**Description:** GitHub token used to increase rate limits when retrieving versions and downloading Spectr. Uses the default GitHub Actions token automatically.
**Required:** No
**Default:** `${{ github.token }}`

### `strict`
**Description:** Treat warnings as errors (enables `--strict` mode). Set to `false` to allow warnings without failing the build.
**Required:** No
**Default:** `true`

## Outputs

### `spectr-version`
**Description:** The version of Spectr that was installed and used for validation.

**Example usage:**
```yaml
- uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1
  id: spectr
- name: Print version
  run: echo "Used Spectr version ${{ steps.spectr.outputs.spectr-version }}"
```

## GitHub Annotations

The action automatically creates GitHub annotations for all validation issues:

- **Errors** (red): Critical problems that must be fixed
- **Warnings** (yellow): Issues that should be addressed (fail in strict mode)
- **Info** (blue): Informational messages

Each annotation includes:
- File path relative to repository root
- Line number where the issue occurs
- Clear description of the problem
- Suggested fixes (when applicable)

Annotations appear:
- In the workflow run logs
- On the "Files changed" tab in pull requests
- In the GitHub UI wherever the file is displayed

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Basic Validation on All Branches

```yaml
name: Spectr Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1
```

### Example 2: Specific Version

```yaml
name: Spectr Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1
        with:
          version: "0.1.0"
```

### Example 3: Non-Strict Mode (Warnings Don't Fail)

```yaml
name: Spectr Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1
        with:
          strict: "false"
```

### Example 4: Pull Request Validation with Custom Token

```yaml
name: PR Validation
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  validate-specs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1
        with:
          version: "0.1.0"
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          strict: "true"
```

### Example 5: Multiple Validation Jobs

```yaml
name: Comprehensive Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate-strict:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Strict validation
        uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1
        with:
          strict: "true"

  validate-warnings-only:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Warning check (non-blocking)
        uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1
        with:
          strict: "false"
        continue-on-error: true
```

## Understanding Output

### In Workflow Logs

The action outputs validation results in the workflow logs:

```
✓ Spec validation passed
  - 12 specs validated
  - 3 active changes validated
  - 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

Or when issues are found:

```
✗ Spec validation failed
  - 12 specs validated
  - 3 active changes validated
  - 2 errors, 1 warning

Errors:
  spectr/changes/add-new-feature/specs/auth/spec.md:15
    Missing required scenario for requirement

Warnings:
  spectr/specs/api/spec.md:42
    Scenario formatting recommendation
```

### In GitHub UI

1. **Workflow Run**: Click on the failed job to see annotated files
2. **Files Changed** (in PRs): Annotations appear inline next to the code
3. **Commit Status**: The action sets commit status with validation results

### Annotation Types

- **Error**: Validation rule violation that must be fixed
  - Missing required sections
  - Invalid spec format
  - Broken references

- **Warning**: Best practice violations (fail in strict mode)
  - Formatting recommendations
  - Potential improvements
  - Style inconsistencies

- **Info**: Helpful information
  - Successful validations
  - Suggestions for improvement

## Troubleshooting

### "Spectr not found" or Version Issues

**Problem:** The action can't find or download Spectr.

**Solutions:**
1. Check if the specified version exists
2. Verify network connectivity to GitHub releases
3. Try specifying `version: "latest"`
4. Check if the `github-token` has sufficient permissions

```yaml
- uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1
  with:
    version: "latest"
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### "Cannot find GITHUB_WORKSPACE"

**Problem:** Environment variables not set correctly.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're using `actions/checkout@v4` before this action
2. Verify you're running on a supported runner (ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest)
3. Check that the workflow has proper permissions

```yaml
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Required!
      - uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1
```

### "JSON parse error"

**Problem:** Spectr output format changed or is invalid.

**Solutions:**
1. Update to the latest action version
2. Check the spectr version compatibility
3. Run `spectr validate --all --strict --json` locally to debug

```yaml
- uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1  # Uses latest action
  with:
    version: "0.1.0"  # Use known good spectr version
```

### "No specs found" or Directory Structure Issues

**Problem:** The action can't find your `spectr/` directory.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `spectr/` directory exists in repository root
2. Ensure you've checked out the repository with `actions/checkout@v4`
3. Check that `spectr/` contains proper structure:
   - `spectr/specs/` for current specifications
   - `spectr/changes/` for active change proposals
   - `spectr/project.md` for project configuration

Expected structure:
```
repository-root/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── spectr.yml
├── spectr/
│   ├── project.md
│   ├── specs/
│   │   └── [capability]/
│   │       └── spec.md
│   └── changes/
│       └── [change-name]/
│           ├── proposal.md
│           └── specs/
└── ...
```

### Validation Fails on Valid Specs

**Problem:** The action reports errors on specs that appear correct.

**Solutions:**
1. Run `spectr validate --all --strict` locally to see detailed output
2. Check for invisible characters or formatting issues
3. Verify spec format follows Spectr conventions (see Spectr documentation)
4. Ensure all requirements have at least one scenario with `#### Scenario:` format

### Action Runs Too Slowly

**Problem:** The action takes a long time to complete.

**Solutions:**
1. Pin to a specific Spectr version instead of using `latest` (caches better)
2. Reduce the number of specs/changes being validated
3. Split validation across multiple jobs if you have many specs

```yaml
- uses: conneroisu/spectr-action@v1
  with:
    version: "0.1.0"  # Cached after first download
```

## Project Requirements

For this action to work properly, your project must:

1. **Have a `spectr/` directory** in the repository root
2. **Contain valid spec structure**:
   - `spectr/project.md` - Project conventions
   - `spectr/specs/` - Current specifications
   - `spectr/changes/` - Active change proposals (optional)
3. **Be a git repository** (required by GitHub Actions)
4. **Use the `actions/checkout` action** before spectr-action

Minimal valid structure:
```
repository-root/
├── spectr/
│   ├── project.md
│   └── specs/
│       └── example-capability/
│           └── spec.md
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── spectr.yml
```
